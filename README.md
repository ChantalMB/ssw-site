# ssw-site

The website for my final project in HIST4101A: Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe with Dr. David Dean. The focus of this project is to explore the intersection between beliefs surrounding fairies, elves, witchcraft, and religion that occured in Early Modern Scotland. 

Website hosted here: https://fates-of-fair.netlify.app/

## TO DO:
- Fix FadeIn

- Replace images with smaller size for better load time
- Figure out how to improve point map loading speed
- Add dropdown selector on streamgraph

## Notes For Local Installation:

1. Download the source code
2. install npm (https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
3. In a terminal, navigate to the website's directoy/folder ex. `cd [path-to-folder]`
4. To download the dependencies, run the following command:
    `"npm install"`
5. Then, to run the site, run "npm start"
6. It should automatically open a browser instance directly to the site, but if not it can be accessed at "http://local:3000/"
