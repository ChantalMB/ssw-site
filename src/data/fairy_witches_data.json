A transcription of some of her case is in Larner et al.'s Sourcebook, p. 269.  Some of her cures invovled moving the sick child around and putting it in a cradle.  She supposedly left her 'witchcraft' on the hearth stone of her former house.  The next family that moved in suffered losses to their cattle.  She caused a cow to be put through a circle of green yarn for a cure."

The giving of remedies was done in the context of drinking ale at the pub, where a local woman was slandered for being a witch and causing an illness that Bartie healed.  He told the man to ask for his health from the woman.  JC26/5/2 has drawings of tables with Latin words laid out that I think Bartie used.  This document has lots of drawings and weird symbols, he could have been accused of learned magical practices.  He used letters and writings for healing.  A remedy for all women involved grinding almonds mixing them with egg whites and putting on their face.  For bleeding at the ???? -write letters on a knife and kill a beast.
